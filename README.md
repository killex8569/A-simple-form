# History
At the very beginning of my studies, I was asked to create a form using several technologies. At first, I thought this project didn’t belong on my GitHub repo, but then I decided to make a new, much more aesthetically pleasing and modern version, allowing me to see my progress.

The goal of this project was to create a form that uses the following technologies, at a minimum:

    HTML
    CSS
    JS
    PHP
    SQL
    A framework or library of choice (I chose a library: jQuery for its simplicity at the time)
    Implement a functional CRUD
# Set up

To use this form, you will need phpMyAdmin. Install the latest version, and once that's done, you can import the database into phpMyAdmin.
Afterward, place the downloaded files in the following Windows directory: C:\wamp64\www
Once the files are in place and phpMyAdmin is set up with the database, you can navigate to the "formulaire.php" page to launch the form.


# info

Please note that some files in this repo are not used in the form; some are just for testing, and others are abandoned
Additionally, I want to point out that the vast majority of comments in the code contain many spelling mistakes, as at the time I didn’t pay attention to them (and I was almost late submitting this assignment).
